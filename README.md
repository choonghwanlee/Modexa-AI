# Modexa-AI

## Motivation

Modexa AI is an agentic data scientist acting as the application layer bridging enterprise data science teams with business users.

Modexa uses agentic planning and decision-making to

- break down business user's high-level questions to actionable data science tasks
- dynamically decide what data and ML models to use to answer the user's questions.

This saves enterprise data science teams months of time building dashboards or building custom software to deploy their models, and also provides end business users with a dynamic & proactive method of engaging with the company's data.
